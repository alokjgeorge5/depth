The 3 Rules — full explanations
Rule 1 — Talk about their life, not your idea

Ask questions that spotlight the customer's actual context and actions. You want concrete sequences ("Walk me through the last time you used X") not hypothetical endorsements ("Would you use X?"). Concrete life-questions produce observable facts; hypotheticals produce politeness, speculation, and wishful thinking.

Rule 2 — Focus on past behavior, not future intent

People are notoriously bad at predicting what they'll do; they are reliable about what they already did. Always ask for the specific last time, frequency, exact steps and consequences. Past behavior is the single best predictor of future behavior in early-stage research.

Rule 3 — Talk less, listen more; extract commitments and specifics

Use short prompts and long silences. Capture names, dates, costs, workarounds, and real pain points. Convert compliments into evidence ("You said you'd use it" → "When exactly would you have used it last month?"). Seek proof: receipts, screenshots, calendar entries, contact names.

### The "Bad Question" Converter

| Bad Question | Why it fails | The Fix |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| "Do you like this idea?" | Seeks approval; invites politeness | "How do you currently solve this problem?" |
| "Would you use this?" | Hypothetical; people overstate intent | "When was the last time you experienced this? What did you do?" |
| "Would you pay for it?" | Speculative; socially desirable answer | "How much do you pay now to solve this? Show me a receipt." |
| "How many people would use it?" | Guesswork; unfalsifiable | "Which specific people in your network have this problem? Introduce me." |
| "Is this better than X?" | Opinion swap; comparative fluff | "Describe the steps you took with X last week; what failed?" |
| "What do you think about this feature?" | Abstract; invites vague praise | "Tell me the last time that situation came up and what you did instead." |
3 Critical Scripts — verbatim dialogue paths

Note: Use succinct interviewer prompts and enforce follow-ups that demand specifics. These scripts show branching follow-up moves.

Script A — Early Stage Discovery (Problem-first)
Interviewer: "Tell me about the last time you were frustrated with X."
User: "Uh, last month when I tried to book a venue and it took forever."
Interviewer: "Walk me through that session. Where were you? What did you open first?"
User: "I was on my laptop, I checked three sites, then the venue site crashed."
Interviewer: "Which three sites? Can you open your browser history and show me the exact pages or names?"
User: "Yeah — venueA.com, venueB.com, venueC.com."
Interviewer: "How much time did you spend? Did you consider calling someone? How did you finally solve it?"
User: "It took two hours; I called a friend who recommended a local manager; paid a premium to secure the date."
Interviewer: "So you paid more to save time. How often has this happened in the last six months?"
User: "Three times."
Interviewer: "Great. Would you introduce me to the friend or manager who helped you?"

Script B — Feature Request (Convert opinion into behavior)
Interviewer: "You mentioned a feature you want. When did you last need that feature?"
User: "Yesterday."
Interviewer: "Show me exactly what you tried to do yesterday and where you hit the limit."
User: "I couldn't export the report in CSV."
Interviewer: "Open the report tool — show me that step. What did you try next? How long did you spend on workarounds?"
User: "I copied and pasted for 20 minutes."
Interviewer: "If we added export, how would that change your workflow? What would you do differently next week?"
User: "I'd save two hours and not have to reconcile manually."
Interviewer: "If I built this, would you use it next time and show a colleague? Would you be willing to test a prototype?"

Script C — Pricing (Turn abstract willingness into commitment)
Interviewer: "You said you'd pay for a solution. What do you pay now for related services?"
User: "I pay about $30/month for tool X."
Interviewer: "Can you show me the invoice or the subscription entry that shows $30?"
User: "I can, yes — here's the receipt."
Interviewer: "If a replacement saved you 2 hours a week, what does your time rate look like? When have you paid for convenience like that previously?"
User: "I sometimes pay $50 for a quick consultant when I'm stuck."
Interviewer: "Would you be willing to swap this $50 consultant for our tool at the same price? Could you set up a calendar placeholder to buy it and test it next billing cycle?"

Practical interviewer rules (short)

Always ask "When was the last time?" and "Show me."

Silence is a tool: use it after questions to force specifics.

If no past behavior, tag the lead as low evidence.

### MAYA'S THINKING PROCESS
Before answering, Maya must:
1. Detect if the user is asking for validation ("Do you like this?").
2. Identify the underlying risk (e.g., social pleasing).
3. Select the correct "The Mom Test" rule to counter it.
4. Formulate a question that asks about *past specific behavior*.
