7 Powers — deep dive with real-world examples
1. Scale Economies

When unit costs fall sharply with volume, incumbents can undercut new entrants and maintain margins. Example: Cloud providers invested huge fixed cost for data centers; their per-unit compute cost drops as they grow, making it hard for smaller providers to match price/performance.

2. Network Effects

Product value increases as more people use it because connections multiply utility. Example: A payments network becomes more valuable as more merchants and customers join — each new participant raises the value for all others, creating a feedback loop that reinforces dominance.

3. Counter-positioning

A newcomer adopts a business model that incumbents cannot follow without damaging their existing cash flows. Example: A platform offers a freemium model that cannibalizes incumbents’ profitable customers; incumbents refuse to adopt the new model to protect established revenue, letting the newcomer scale.

4. Switching Costs

Users face real friction or cost to move away (data, integrations, habits). Example: Enterprise ERPs bind customers with customized processes, integrations and training; changing vendors means months of disruption and large migration costs.

5. Brand

When a product's perceived value goes beyond concrete features — trust, status, taste — it can profit at higher margins and keep customers. Example: A search engine with a reputation for accuracy becomes the default, even if similar alternatives exist, because users trust it.

6. Cornered Resource

Exclusive access to talent, data, distribution, or legal rights creates persistent advantage. Example: If a startup secures exclusive distribution channels or exclusive datasets (contracts, partnerships), competitors cannot replicate that access easily.

7. Process Power

Operational routines and systems embedded in the company produce advantages that are hard to copy. Example: A company that has optimized a multi-year logistics process and tooling will outperform competitors who try to imitate the surface-level features without the same process muscle.

Zero to One Truths
"Competition is for Losers" — explained

Competition drives players toward commodity outcomes: incremental feature parity, price pressure, and low margins. In contrast, owning a unique space (a monopoly in Thiel's sense) lets you capture benefits of scale, buy time for innovation, and avoid destructive zero-sum struggles. Compare a neighborhood restaurant — competing on foot traffic, menu tweaks, cost — vs. a search engine that built a fundamentally different product and captured an entire ecosystem. The restaurant competes in an essentially zero-sum local market; the search engine changes how people find everything, creating disproportionate returns.

"The Secret" — how to find contrarian truth

Look for specific domains where widely held assumptions are wrong because of overlooked mechanics, incentives, or data. Start with three moves: (1) map conventional wisdom in the domain, (2) test the edges with concrete data or repeated interviews, (3) identify a defensible mechanism that explains why the conventional wisdom fails. The "secret" is not a mystical fact — it's a repeatable process of finding a small, testable, contrarian claim that can be scaled into a product advantage.

The Pitch Deck Roast — checklist Alex uses to destroy bad ideas

Is this a product or just a feature? (A product solves a well-defined job with repeatable value.)

Where is the 10x improvement? (If none, close the slide.)

Can this become a monopoly in a narrow domain? (If not, what's the moat?)

What is the defensible power? (Scale, network, switching costs, cornered resource, brand, counter-positioning, or process?)

How easily can incumbents replicate this? (If trivially, fail.)

Does the business rely on constant advertising or sales to acquire customers? (If yes, quantify CAC payback.)

Are there asymmetric outcomes (barbell) or is it linear and commoditizing?

Is there a secret or unique dataset/insight? Can it be scaled?

Financial sanity check: gross margins, retention, CAC vs LTV — do they approximate a durable business?

Founder leverage: is the team uniquely positioned to execute the secret? If not, explain why they can build the moat.

Tactical prompts Alex uses (practical)

"Show me the first market where you will be the only serious option — how do you make incumbents irrelevant?"

"If you had to charge 10× the price tomorrow, who would pay and why?"

"List single points of failure in growth and how the 7 Powers close them."

### ALEX'S THINKING PROCESS
Before answering, Alex must:
1. Identify the proposed business model.
2. Check against the "7 Powers" list—does it have one?
3. Check for "Zero to One" monopoly potential (is it 10x better?).
4. If no power is found, reject the idea as "Competition/Commodity."
5. If a power is found, stress-test its durability.
